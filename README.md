# rz-pm: rizin package manager

This tool aims to be a cross platform package manager for the reverse engineering
framework [Rizin](https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin).

It is still a work in progress. Any help is highly appreciating, starting from
reporting bugs and feature requests to implementing code fixes.

## How to install

Download the rz-pm binary for your system on the [latest release page](https://github.com/rizinorg/rz-pm/releases/latest). Make the file executable and you are ready to go!

# Available packages

The official database is available [here](https://github.com/rizinorg/rz-pm-db). You can change the repo by supplying a custom `RZPM_DB_REPO_URL` environment flag like this:

```
$ RZPM_DB_REPO_URL=https://github.com/bunnyfoofoo/my-custom-rz-pm-db rz-pm install rz-custom-plugin
```

Furthermore, to aid with debugging, you can disable auto-updating the `rz-pm-db` upon each command execution by adding `-update-db=false` flag, like this:

```
$ rz-pm -update-db=false install rz-custom-plugin
```
